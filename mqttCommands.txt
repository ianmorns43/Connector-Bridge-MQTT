commands:
heartbeat
    The hub occasionally (~every 60s) multicasts a heartbeat message. The bridge publises this as a hub/heartbeat message

    Bridge will publish:
        a hub/deviceList message
        followed by a  status update for each device
    
moveShade
openShade
closeShade
stopShade
    Bridge will send the appropriate movement message to the hub    
    Bridge will publish a device commandReceive when hub receives the command

    for bi-directional blinds
    Bridge will publish a device moveComplete when shade completes its move 

    for single-deirectional blinds
    Bridge will publish a device moveComplete when hub broadcasts the command
